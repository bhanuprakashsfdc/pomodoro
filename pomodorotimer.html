                <h2>Introduction to the Pomodoro Timer</h2>
                <p>
                    In our fast-paced world, managing time efficiently is crucial for both personal and professional growth. The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, is a time management method that has gained widespread popularity for its simplicity and effectiveness. This technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "Pomodoros."

                <h2>What is a Pomodoro Timer?</h2>
                <p>
                    A Pomodoro timer is a simple yet powerful tool to help manage your working sessions. It alternates work periods with short rest breaks to maximize concentration and minimize fatigue. Each work session is followed by a 5-minute break, and every fourth break is extended to 15-30 minutes, providing a longer respite.

                <h2>How Does It Help?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhancing Focus: Short, timed sessions help you stay focused on tasks without getting burnt out.</li>
                    <li>Increasing Productivity: Regular breaks ensure that your mind stays fresh, allowing you to maintain a high level of productivity throughout the day.</li>
                    <li>Reducing Procrastination: Knowing you only have to focus for a short period makes daunting tasks seem more manageable.</li>
                    <li>Improving Time Management: By tracking how many Pomodoros it takes to complete tasks, you can better estimate the time needed for future tasks.</li>

                <h2>Building a Pomodoro Timer with HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    The following HTML code provides the structure for a basic Pomodoro timer web application. This application features buttons to start, pause, and reset the timer, and it includes options for different session types: a focus session, a short break, and a long break.
